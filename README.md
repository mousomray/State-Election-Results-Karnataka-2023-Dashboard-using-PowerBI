# Data Importing and Cleaning 
After collecting the data and importing it into PowerBI performed various activities in Power Query Editor like,
removing duplicates, removing missing values, removing unimportant columns, adding new columns for need (Using Dax query) and transforming the data into a format that can be easily analyzed. 

# Data Processing 
The election data divided into multiple datasets or files, such as constituency-wise results, voter turnout, candidate information, and more. 
So created party_name column(using power query) in all datasets which is creating relationships between different tables, defining hierarchies, or creating calculated measures that can be used for advanced calculations or filtering in the dashboard.
